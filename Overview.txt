* Race condition 			
		
* Liveness Problems
	- Deadlock: Thread 1 waits for a resource that thread 2 is holding
		exclusively and thread 2 is waiting for a resource that thread 1 is
		holding exclusively. Neither thread can make progress.
	- Livelock: Thread x keeps retrying an operation that will always
		fail. It cannot make progress for this reason.
	- Starvation: Thread x is continually denied (by the scheduler)
		access to a needed resource in order to make progress. Perhaps
		the scheduler executes higher-priority threads before
		lower-priority threads and there is always a higher-priority thread
		available for execution. Starvation is also commonly referred to as
		indefinite postponement.
